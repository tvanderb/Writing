# Don't Try to Have Everything

You may look at the rich and say "man, don't they just have everything," and sure, they certainly have a lot. They definitely have more money than you, you wouldn't be calling them rich if they didn't. Sure, they definitely have the economic front covered, currently, yet they too have their fair share of problems. Don't forget, having money is challenging; where is all yours?

You may look at the powerful and say "man, don't they just have everything," and yeah, they certainly got a lot. They definitely have more sway over people than you, you wouldn't be calling them powerful otherwise. For sure, they've got a whole lot of influence, for now, yet they too have their fair share of problems. Remember, "positions of power" are positions of overwhelming responsibility. Who wants that?

Problems are probably the one constant among life. No matter where you are, or what you have, you're always going to want more. If not, why do you keep doing things? Doing anything requires effort. This is what drives our world forward. The pursuit of more. Just a hundred years ago we had exponentially less than what we have now. What convinced us all that effort to obtain more would be worth it? If we were ever permanently satisfied, we wouldn't do anything, not at all.

No one has everything. Not one person. So far, humans occupy one planet in our universe, there's only a small amount to go around. You may think I'm being unreasonable. But really, am I? The universe is the absolute most we know exists.

No one can ever have everything. Even if one day, you miraculously came into possession of everything, you wouldn't be able to maintain all that. Chances are you don't even always keep your room in order! What makes you think you can manage literally everything? Who the hell do you think you are?

Life is about making sacrifices. Every day plants and animals die so you can eat breakfast. You sacrifice knowing everything, so you can at least know some things. You sacrifice the potential to have any other partner, for the security of knowing you already have just one. You sacrifice time spent in front of the TV to work, so that you and your family have a roof over their heads and a bed to sleep in at night.

You must make sacrifices. You can't do everything all at once, and you sure as hell can't even do everything ever. Why not make your sacrifices worth something attainable, and something you can maintain? Why not make your sacrifices worth it? Just doing whatever pleases you may be attainable, but it's certainly not maintainable. Do good in school so you can be knowledgeable and skilled when you truly realize the value in that. Eat healthy food and get good exercise now so you can be strong and capable while you still can, and pig out when you're old and dying. As wonderful as they may be, cocaine and hookers aren't the answer to life. Boy, that'd be something.

You are constantly sacrificing your time. Each passing moment is time you no longer have, a moment closer to death, the ultimate sacrifice. And what will that ultimate sacrifice be for? What will triumphing over all that adversity be for? All that pain and suffering? What will you have sacrificed the absolute entirety of your life for? Start with something attainable, at least then you will have done something. Then, see if you can maintain it. You can always improve on what you have. Don't overestimate yourself. Make your life worth it.
