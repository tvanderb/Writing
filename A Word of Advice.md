# A Word of Advice

Don't give up, do your best, and accept the outcome. Your life is a miracle, and you'll only have one chance at it. Every moment that goes by, your window into that opportunity shrinks; your life will end, and it may end tomorrow, or even today: this may be your last opportunity to do good with what you have.

You exist in the most unique possible way. You can let other people take advantage of that, or you can adopt responsibility and hold yourself accountable for yourself. No one else is you, no one else will ever have everything you do in the way that you have it. Your past, your present, your future, your self, your thoughts, your dreams, your aspirations. The only person who can do anything with it is you, you're the only person who can make any of it meaningful.

There is nothing meaningful in never having accomplished anything, and you will never have accomplished something if you have never struggled, but if you do struggle, for whatever reason, and you make it through, you will then have accomplished something. Existing without a struggle is living your life as if you are an infant with a pacifier.

You don't want to be an infant, of course. If then, what do you want to be? How about a brave soldier, armed and ready, a force to be reckoned with, at the ready to face whatever battle confronts you? That sounds respectable, perhaps the most respectable. A brave soldier does not go into battle expecting it to be without struggle, he expects it to be the struggle of his life. A brave soldier is honest, he does what is right. A brave soldier is courageous, not deterred by the challenge of his duty. A brave soldier is humble, he makes mistakes, holds himself accountable for them, and learns from them. A brave soldier is an ideal to strive for.

The hardest struggles are the most challenging, the most rewarding of challenges. A never ending struggle is not ever rewarding. If your life is a constant struggle, there are two explanations: either you are being tyrannized by someone or something, and therefore are not in control, or you're not doing anything about it.

Now, if you fall under the former, if you are a subject to tyranny, you are being required to do things by something or someone else. Always remember: you don't have to. If you are being required to do things that make you feel weak and ashamed, stop, don't do them. A brave soldier does not shut up and keep his head down when he sees that something is wrong, a brave soldier speaks up and contends with tyranny.

If you fall under the latter, if you aren't doing anything to get your life in order, then that's your fault, and you know full well what you have to do. Ask yourself, what is one thing I don't like about my life? It could be as simple as having a messy room. If you wanna change your life, you gotta change some things in your life, and you certainly are able to.

Don't give up on life, no matter how hard it gets, you have the opportunity of a lifetime in your pocket. If you don't like where you are, do better. If you really have done your best, you better accept the outcome, because you can't do any better.
